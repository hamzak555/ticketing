## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up Supabase:

   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor

3. Configure environment variables:

   - Copy `.env.local` and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Database Setup

The database schema includes three main tables:

- **businesses**: Store business profiles and custom URLs
- **events**: Manage events with ticket inventory and pricing
- **tickets**: Track ticket sales and customer information

Run the `supabase-schema.sql` file in your Supabase SQL Editor to create all necessary tables, indexes, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
